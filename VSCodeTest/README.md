This is a discontinued Project that was developed to iteract between NodeJS, AngularJs and Python Code.

The main idea was:

> The user can interact from the Browser (AngularJs) with some tools or controls. This actions or operations will remotely call to Web services (RESTFul) , implemented using NodeJs. Then, inside the NodeJs implementation, this will call to Pyhon scrpts code, to apply ceratin operations. 
> Finally those Outputs (from text files, images generated or Database) could be access from NodeJS Server, so thay can be used for the callbacks.
