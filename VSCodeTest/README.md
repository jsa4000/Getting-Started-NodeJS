This is a **discontinued** Project developed to interact between some different technologies such as **NodeJS**, **AngularJs** and **Python**.

The main idea was:

> The user can interact from the Browser (AngularJs) with some tools or controls. The actions and operations will be remotely call to Web services (RESTFul), implemented using NodeJs. Inside the NodeJs implementation, this will call to Pyhon scripts code, to apply certain operations. 
> Finally those Outputs (from text files, images generated or Database) could be access from NodeJS Server, so thay can be used for the callbacks.

For setting up this project I used **Visual Studio Code**. Following are some of the basic features:

- Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. 
- It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. 
- It is also customizable, so users can change the editor's theme, keyboard shortcuts, and preferences. It is free and open-source, although the official download is under a proprietary license.
- Visual Studio Code is based on Electron, a framework which is used to deploy Node.js applications for the desktop running on the Blink layout engine. Although it uses the Electron framework, the software is not a fork of Atom, it is actually based on Visual Studio Online's editor (codename "Monaco").
